Chapter 4: Control Structures I (Selection)
- A computer can proceed:
+ In sequence
+ Selectively (branch): making a choice
+ Repetitively (iteratively): looping
- Some statements are executed only if certain conditions are met
- A condition is met if it evaluates to true
- Relational Operators
+ A condition is represented by a logical (Boolean) expression that can be true or false
+ Ex: ==; !=; <; >; >=; <=
- Relational Operators and the string type
+ Relational Operators can be applied to strings
+ Strings are compared character by character, starting with the first character
+ Comparison continues until either a mismatch is found or all characters are found equal
+ If two strings of different lengths are compared and the comparison is equal to the last of the shorter string
+ The shorter string is less than the larger string
- Logical Operators and Logical Expression
+ Boolean operators enable you to combine logical expressions
+ Ex: ! = not; && = and; || = or
- One-way selection:
+ The statement is executed if the value of the Expression is true
+ The statement is bypassed if the value is false and the program goes to the next statement
- Two-way selection:
+ If the expression is true, statement1 is executed; otherwise, statement2 is executed
- Compound (Block of) statements:
+ A compound statement is a single statement
+ No need for a semicolon at the end
- Multiple selections: Nested if
+ Nesting: One control statement in another
+ An else is associated with the most recent if that has not been paired with an else
+ You can nest control statements in compound statements to remove some of the ambiguity or organize your code
- Short-Circuit Evaluation:
+ Evaluation of a logical expression stops as soon as the value of the expression is known
- Conditional Operator (?:)
+ Takes three arguments (ternary operator)
+ If expression1 is true, the result of the conditional expression is expression2; otherwise, the result is conditional expression3
- Switch structures:
+ Alternative to if-else
+ Switch (integral) expression is evaluated first
+ Value of the expression determines which corresponding action is taken
+ Expression is sometimes called the selector
- Terminating a Program with the assert function
+ Certain types of errors that are very difficult to catch can occur in a program
+ The predefined function assert is useful in stopping program execution when certain elusive errors occur
+ Must #include <cassert>, to disable it add #define NDEBUG before the preprocessor
