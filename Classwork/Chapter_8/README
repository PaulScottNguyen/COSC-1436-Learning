Chapter 8: Arrays and Strings

Data Types
- A data type is called simple if variables of that type can store only one value at a time
- A structured data type is one in which each data item is a collection of other data items

Arrays
- Array: a collection of a fixed number of components wherein all of the components have the same data type
- In a one-dimensional array, the components are arranged in a list form
- Syntax: DataType ArrayName[intExp];
+ <intExp> evaluates to a positive integer and should be a constant

Accessing Array Components
- General syntax: ArrayName[indexExp];
+ where <indexExp>, called index, is any expresison whose value is a nonnegative integer
- Index value specifies the position of the component in the array
- [] is the array subscripting operator
- The array index always starts at 0 and ends with intExp-1

Processing One-Dimensional Arrays
- Some basic operations performed on a one-dimensional array are:
+ Initializing
+ Inputting data
+ Outputting data stored in array
+ Finding the largest and/or smallest element
- Each operation requires ability to step through the elements of the array
- Easily accomplished by a loop

Array Index Out of Bounds
- In C++, there is no guard against indices that are out of bounds

Array Initialization During Declaration
- Array can be initialized during declaration
- In this case, it is not necessary to specify the size of the array and the size is determined by the number of initial values in the curly brackets

Restrictions on Array Processing
- C++ does not allow aggregate operations on an array

Arrays as Parameters to Functions
- Arrays are passed by reference only
+ The symbol & is not used when passing an array as a formal parameter
+ The size of an array is usually omitted and it is usually send as another parameter
+ When we pass an array as a parameter, the base address of the actual array is passed to the formal parameter
- C++ does not allow functions to return a value of the type array

Arrays and enum
- C++ allows any integral type to be used as an array index
- First element has to be 0

Searching an Array for a specific item
- Sequential search or linear search
+ Searching a list for a given item
+ Starting from the first array element
+ Compare searchItem with the elements in the array
+ Continue the search until either you find the item or no motr data is left in the list to compare with searchItem

Sorting
- Selection sort rearrange the list by selecting an element and moving it to its proper position in the array
+ Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list
+ Move it to the top of the unsorted portion by swapping with the element currently there
+ Start again with the rest of the list

Auto Declaration and Range-Based for loops
- C++ allows auto declaration of variables
+ Data type does not need to be specified
+ Example: auto num = 15

C-strings (Character arrays)
- An array whose components are of type char
- C-strings are null-terminated('\0' - null character) character arrays
- Example:
+ 'A' is character A
+ "A" is the C-string A which represents 'A' and '\0'
- Just use normal string gng

Two-and Multidimensional arrays
- 2D Array: collection of a fixed number of components (of the same data type) arranged in two dimensions
- Syntax: DataType ArrayName[intExp1][intExp2];
+ where intExp1 and intExp2 are expressions yielding positive integer values, and specify the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively, in the array

Accessing Array Components
- Syntax: ArrayName[indexExp1][indexExp2];

Initialization During Declarationh
- Elements of each row are enclosed within braces and separated by commas
- All rows are enclosed within braces
- For number arrays, unspecified are set to 0
- Example: int matrix[2][3] = {
    {0,1,2},
    {10,11,12}
}

Processing Two-Dimensional Arrays
- Ways to process a 2D array
+ Process the entire array
+ Process a particular row of the array, called row processing
+ Process a particular column of the array, called column processing
- Each row and each column of a two dimensional array is a one dimensional array

Passing 2D Arrays as Parameters to functions
- Parameters to Functions
+ Two dimensional arrays can be passed as parameters to a function
* Pass by reference: Base address (address of first component of the actual parameter) is passed to formal parameter
+ Two dimensional arrays are stored in row order
+ When declaring a 2D array as a formal parameter, can omit size of first dimension, but not the second

Parallel Arrays
- Two (or more) arrays are called parallel if their corresponding components hold related information

Multidimensional Arrays
- Syntax: DataType ArrayName[intExp1][intExp2]...[intExpN];
- Syntax: ArrayName[indexExp1][indexExp2]...[indexExpN];
