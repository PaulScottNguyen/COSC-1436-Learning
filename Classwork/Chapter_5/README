Chapter 5: Control Structures II (Repetition)
Why is Repetition needed?
- Allows us to efficiently use variables and memory
- Validate values
- Program faster
- Generate patterns
while Looping structure
- Syntax: while (expression) statement;
- Expression acts as a decision maker and is usually a logical expression
- Statement is called the body of the loop and can be simple or compound
- Infinite loop: continues to execute endlessly
+ Not solving the problem, not an algorithm
+ Avoided by including statements in loop body that assure exit condition is eventually false
- Case 1: Counter-Controlled Loops
+ If you know exactly how many times you need to repeat
- Case 2: Sentinel-Controlled Loops
+ Loop ends when sentinel variable is encountered
- Case 3: Flag-Controlled Loops
+ A flag-controlled loop uses a bool variable to control the loop
- Case 4: EOF-Controlled Loops
+ Use an EOF (End Of File)-Controlled loop to read from an input stream (File) as long as there is something in that stream

EOF Function
- The function eof can determine the end of file status
- Is true when you read beyond the end of the file
- eof is a member of data type istream
- Syntax: istreamVar.eof()
+ istreamVar is an input stream variable such as cin or a input file variable

For looping (Repetition) Structure
- The general form of the for statement is:
- Syntax: for (InitialStatement; LoopCondition; UpdateStatement) Statement;

do...while looping (Repetition) Structure
- General form of a do...while
- Syntax: do statement; while (expression);
- The statement executes first then the expression is evaluated
- To avoid an infinite loop, body must contain a statement that makes the expression false
- The statement can be simple or compound
- Loop always iterates at least once

Choosing the right looping structure
- If you know or can determine in advance the number of repetitions needed, the for loop is the correct choice
- If you do not know and cannot determine in advance the number of repetitions needed, and it could be zero, use a while loop
- If you do not know and cannot determine in advance the number of repetitions, and it is at least one, use a do...while loop

break and continue statements
- break and continue alter the flow of control
- break statement is used for two purposes:
+ To exit early from a loop
* Can eliminate the use of certain flag variables
+ To skip the remainder of the switch structure
- After the break statement executes, the program continues with the first statement after the structure
- continue is used in while, for, and do...while structures
- When executed in a loop, it skips remaining statements and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop
